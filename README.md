# Data_Visualization_Floor_plan
Abstract:
This research project aims to explore the potential of building sensor data to improve the understanding of a
buildingâ€™s overall workings. Specifically, the project focuses on collecting and analyzing sensor data from Sutardja
Dai Hall, an important part of the UC Berkeley campus.
By developing an interactive dashboard that deploys visualizations using plan drawings of the building, the project
seeks to simplify the analysis of the sensor data and make it
easier to understand its spatial location analyses within the
building. The dashboard will have a range of use cases,
including integrating with BIM modelling, understanding
energy and utility needs, and predicting future failures in
building maintenance services. Through this project, we
hope to showcase the power of building sensor data and
its potential to transform the management and maintenance
of buildings.
